# brewhaus
A take home test designing an API interface for a fictitious company

Welcome to Brewhaus!

Please design a simple website using a modern JavaScript framework (prefer Vue 2.0 or 3.0) for the fictitious company BREWHAUS using the API https://www.openbrewerydb.org/

Features of this website should include:
- Main page listing out breweries
- Pagination or lazy loading of breweries
- Simple search function of breweries
- Details page where a user can find out more information about specific breweries

Feel free to embellish beyond that.

While you are not obligated to use them, this repo comes with an API file and a Brewhaus image. **You are free to use anything else you would like!**

Good luck!
